# InBooker
Simple Flask WebApp that performs GET and POST request to a transportation management system api. The purpose of InBooker is to automate some tedious tasks and more importantly;
to reduce human error. The idea is to start out with just the 'barebone' and add functionalities based on requirements opposed by the users. And lastly does InBooker serve as a hobby
project where I challenge myself to implement new features or improve existing functionalities as this is my first attempt to web development

# Added functionalities:
-Added a barcodescanning SDK's such as Quagga, ZXing and Scandit
-Added servicelevel
-Forced use of https:// paths
-External login (TMS system)
